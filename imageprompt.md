Create a flat vector-style illustration with solid color fills only (no gradients, no shading, no texture, no lighting effects).

Use approximately 12–20 clearly separated colors with high contrast between adjacent areas.

All color boundaries should be sharp and clean — no blur, glow, anti-aliasing, or soft transitions.

Style should resemble clean SVG vector art with bold shape separation.

No gradients. No textures. No dithering. No soft shadows.

Each area of color should be uniform and uninterrupted.

Ensure every color area is perfectly uniform with zero variation, suitable for color clustering and region labeling algorithms.

Example Use Cases

Instead of:

"A beautiful realistic sunset landscape"

Use:

"A flat vector-style sunset landscape with solid color blocks, no gradients, no shading…"
